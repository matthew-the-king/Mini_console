# Mini_console *only works on Windows 11!
My project opens up a console window and acts as if it's a command line.  I call it the HORSE console.

To use, simply install the file and extract all.  Then go to Mini_console-main/Mini_command_line/x64/debug and run the .exe file.  Microsoft Windows Defender might stop you from running it. To continue, click "More Info" and then click Run Anyway.


for usage, type help into the HORSE console and press enter. No spaces are allowed on any of the commands!


Features:
1. File system 
2. Arithmetic
3. Console Customization
To see the commands, type "help" in the command line!
