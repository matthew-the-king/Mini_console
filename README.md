# Mini_console *only works on Windows 11!
My project opens up a console window and acts as if it's a command line.  I call it the HORSE console.

To use, simply install the .exe file.  Then run the .exe file.  Microsoft Windows Defender might stop you from running it. To continue, click "More Info" and then click Run Anyway.


There are many commands; here is the list:
1. filenew -creates a new file

2. fileread -reads a file
   
4. filewrite -writes to a file
   
4 .foldernew -creates a new folder 

5. sumof -adds two numbers

6. diffrenceof -finds the difference of two numbers
   
7 .productof -finds the product of two numbers

8. quotientof -finds the quotient of two numbers
   
9.sin() -finds sin(inputed_angle)

10.cos() -finds cos(inputed_angle)

11.tan() -finds tan(inputed_angle)

12 .color -changes text color (blue, light blue, purple, red, yellow, green, white)

NONE of the commands have parameters in the first line; the command line will ask you for them.  If you need help, you can type "help" into the console to get the same list.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:
1. All file commands need a path to work; for example, C:/MY_FOLDER is a path.  If no path is specified, the file will default to the path of the .exe file.
2. The commands cannot have uppercase or spaces in them, commands with uppercase letters or spaces will not work!
3. This command line is not a finished product and will have bugs. If you see any bugs, please report them so I can fix them. 

Features:
1. File system 
2. Arithmetic
3. Console Customization
To see the commands, type "help" in the command line!
