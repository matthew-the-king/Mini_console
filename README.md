# Mini_console
My project opens up a console window and acts as if it's a command line.  I call it the HORSE console.

To use, simply install the file and extract all.  Then go to Mini_console-main/Mini_command_line/x64/debug and run the .exe file.  Microsoft Windows Defender might stop you from running it. To continue, click "More Info" and then click Run Anyway.
